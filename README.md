## Chat/Messaging App Light and Dark Theme - Flutter UI 
Gonna build messing/chat app #ui using #flutter that runs both Android and iOS devices and also has a dark and light theme. I create in total 4 screens all of that support both Dark Theme and Light Theme. At first, I designed a welcome screen that contains an image with a tagline also has a skip button. Once the user press, it transfers to the Sign-in or Sign-up screen. The last two screens are the main screen, Chats screens it shows the list of people you are chated with. At the end message screen support text message, audio message, and video messages.
